                What is web development?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves tasks such as web design, content creation, client-side/server-side scripting, and web server configuration.

                What are the essential languages for web development?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone for structuring web pages, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles the HTML elements, and JavaScript adds interactivity to websites. Additionally, server-side languages like PHP, Python, or Node.js are used for dynamic content generation.

                What's the difference between front-end and back-end development?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Front-end development focuses on the client-side of a website, involving the design, layout, and interactions that users experience directly in their web browsers. Back-end development deals with server-side operations, managing databases, and handling requests and responses between the server and client.

                What tools and frameworks are commonly used in web development?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Popular front-end frameworks include React, Angular, and Vue.js, which streamline the development process and offer reusable components. For back-end development, frameworks like Express.js (Node.js), Django (Python), and Laravel (PHP) are widely used. Additionally, tools like Git for version control and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) such as Visual Studio Code are commonly employed.

                What are some key considerations for creating a responsive website?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Responsive web design ensures that a website adapts and looks good on various devices and screen sizes. Designers achieve this through techniques like fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. Prioritizing mobile-first design, optimizing images and resources for faster loading times, and testing across multiple devices and browsers are essential for a seamless user experience.
